# snippet.sh — the canonical rc snippet (DESIGN.md §6.7, D26). This is the line
# that lands in users' shell rc files and stays there for years: it keeps the
# contractual install dir on PATH and performs a one-time bootstrap install.
#
# Canonical source: rocne/release-ci, installer/snippet.sh. Vendored beside
# install.sh to consumers that surface an rc snippet (today: dstow). Everything
# below the config block is byte-identical across consumers.
#
# This file is *sourced* from a user's rc, so it must never break shell
# startup and must leave nothing behind: the config vars are RELEASE_CI_-
# prefixed (a bare REPO/TOOL would clobber the user's own variables — the same
# collision class D8/D21 killed for INSTALL_DIR) and are unset on every path.

# ---- vendored config (per-consumer; everything below is canonical) ----
RELEASE_CI_REPO=""   # GitHub slug, e.g. rocne/dstow. Set at vendor time.
RELEASE_CI_TOOL=""   # installed binary name. Set at vendor time.
# ---- end vendored config ----

# The PATH line bakes the contractual default (F3): consumer snippets may rely
# on the *default* resolving to ~/.local/bin; the installer's dir is otherwise
# fully tunable (D9). Prepended before the guard, so the guard sees it (B1).
